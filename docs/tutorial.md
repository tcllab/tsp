# Tutorial

Converting an existing Tcl proc into one that can be compiled by TSP.  
We'll take a Tcl proc, and make the necessary code changes for compilation
with TSP.

## Sample

```
some tcl proc with line numbers
```

## Make it a `tsp::proc` and add a `tsp::procdef`

## Simplify expressions

## Define variable types

## Ensure `return` is coded and matches `tsp::procdef` type

## Add `tsp::volatile` if needed

## Check TSP compilation log
